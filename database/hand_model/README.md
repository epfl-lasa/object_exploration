Hand model has been generated by calling the function `hand = create_hand_model('AllegroHandLeft', eye(4), true);` in the project of `hand_dexterity/`.
Then the hand model along with its reachability map and collision map has been saved in `hand_dir.AllegroHandLeft.root`, namely: `/home/kunpeng/Workspace/hand_dexterity/database/AllegroHandLeft`.
